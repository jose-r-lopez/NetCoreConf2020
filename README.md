# VirtualNetCoreConf2020
Source files of the examples of my Virtual .Net Core Conf 2020 presentation

This is a ready-to-use Visual Studio 2019 solution file with the library and some testing code. To reproduce the results of the conference talk you need to put a real password file into de /data directory. The rockyou.txt file used in the tests is widely available over the Internet or in security related Linux distributions, but you can use any password file you please. Sorry for the inconvenience. 

The presentation PDF will be uploaded soon.
